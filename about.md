I've been doing iOS and Mac stuff for a few years now, and this is still what I do for a living.  I've also been known to build the odd web application using things like Meteor and Ruby on rails.  In a previous life I worked in investment banks using things like C++, C, Bash, Perl and some Java.


## Current role

Currently working at an awesome startup with some very [clever folks](https://www.light.house).

## Stuff I do / have done lots of in the past

* **iOS / Mac** - `Swift` / `Objective C` / `Pretty much everything on iOS` / `Cocoa`
* **Web** - `HTML` / `CSS` / `JS` / `Meteor` / `Ruby on Rails`
* **Scripting** - `Ruby` / `Python` / `Perl` / `Shell` 
* **Other** - `C++` / `C` / `+ a bunch of other stuff I can't be bothered to write down.`
    
    
## Things I've done


* [**Lighthouse mobile App**](http://www.light.house) 
   
   A fairly complicated app involving h264, live video streaming, live audio (although I didn't do much of that), and all the usual iOS stuff such as geofences, notifications, UIKit.  Written in Swift.  Not yet in the App Store.

* [**Air New Zealand Mobile App**](https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/air-nz-app) 

   A very well used iOS app written in Objective C allowing you to check your flights and airpoints status.  Highlight include a coffee ordering component which allows to order your coffee in th AIRNZ lounge, with some nice animations using CAShapeLayers.  Lots of UICollectionViews used, mostly with custom layouts.

* [**Sharper Notes**](https://www.sharpernotes.com) 

   Sharper Notes is my guitar / music practice website, which I use to organise my own guitar practice time,  A work in progress.

* **yLIP**

   yLIP was a Mac desktop app which allowed to easily create and publish iOS mobile apps just by using the gui provided.  I think it was pretty cool, but I didn't make enough money out of it and had to kill it. Some tutorial videos still survive [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOTnfbS7-60) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBu4xkdMA5Y).

* **Apps**

  Quite a few other iOS, some written for my own company, some for other people.  All historical now though.

Hello, and welcome to my little site.  This will probably be my one and only blog post, and I'm going to make it a short one.  My name is Andy and I'm a software developer working mostly in mobile space on iOS devices.  I've been at this for a while now, so more or less know what I'm doing.  Check out my about page for some more details, or to contact me.
